## üéØ What is ThreadFlow?
ThreadFlow is a modern full-stack application that demonstrates the power of C programming for backend services, combined with a sleek Next.js frontend. It showcases efficient thread management, real-time communication, and high-performance task processing.

## üåü Why C?
I created ThreadFlow to dive deep into system programming and understand:
- How modern web servers handle concurrent connections
- Memory management and optimization techniques
- Thread pools and task queue implementations
- Low-level networking and system calls
- Performance optimization at the system level

## üèó Architecture

### Backend (C)
The core server is built with:
- `libmicrohttpd` for HTTP server capabilities
- Custom thread pool implementation
- Priority-based task queue system
- Signal handling for graceful shutdown

Key features:
- Non-blocking I/O operations
- Efficient thread management
- RESTful API endpoints
- Memory-efficient design patterns
- Configurable task processing delay for visualization

### Frontend (Next.js)
Modern web interface featuring:
- Efficient polling mechanism for updates
- Server-side rendering for optimal performance
- Clean, responsive UI with compact design
- TurboPack for rapid development
- Single-page layout with minimal scrolling

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- GCC compiler
- Make build system
- Docker (optional)
- Node.js and npm

### Building the Backend
bash
cd backend
make
### Starting the Frontend
bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
### Using Docker
bash
docker-compose up --build

### Environment Variables
The application supports the following environment variables:
- `PORT`: HTTP server port (default: 8081)
- `TASK_PROCESSING_DELAY`: Delay in seconds for task processing (default: 5)

## üìö Learning Highlights
Through building ThreadFlow, I've gained hands-on experience with:
- Thread synchronization primitives
- Memory management and leak prevention
- Network programming in C
- System-level optimizations
- Integration of C services with modern web technologies

## üîß Technical Deep Dive
### Thread Pool Design
- Custom implementation of worker threads
- Task queue with priority scheduling
- Mutex and condition variables for synchronization
- Graceful shutdown handling

### Network Layer
- HTTP server on port 8081
- RESTful API for task submission and status updates
- Efficient polling mechanism for task status
- JSON-based communication

### Memory Management
- Custom memory pool for frequent allocations
- Careful tracking of allocated resources
- Proper cleanup on shutdown
- Valgrind-verified memory safety

### UI Design
- Compact single-page layout
- Task monitoring with polling
- Priority-based task submission
- Visual progress indicators
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

## üÜï Recent Updates
- Added configurable task processing delay for better visualization
- Implemented real-time progress updates during task processing
- Redesigned UI for a more compact, single-page experience
- Improved task monitoring with streamlined status indicators
- Enhanced responsive layout for better mobile experience
